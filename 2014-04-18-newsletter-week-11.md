Good news everyone! It’s week 11 – that means it’s time for another SSE newsletter!

In the last two weeks we’ve had a huge number of successful events:

* Skyvo visited the lab and told us about themselves
* Lee Avital gave an excellent talk on Erlang
* We had two successful review sessions – one for CS 2 and one for SE 261
* We built a massive box fort in the atrium
* Greg Giacovelli visited on behalf of ViSE committee and gave a talk
* Castle Company gave a presentation about themselves.

Professor Lutz just gave a talk on the History of the Software Engineering program, and we livestreamed it! If you happened to miss it, it should be available for your viewing pleasure.
