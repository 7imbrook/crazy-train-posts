Good day everyone! It’s the start of week 5 – and a busy week it is! This week is the week of the career fair, and we have tons of companies visiting the lab this week to complement the campus event!

Last Saturday we had a highly successful Mock Interview Day – each interviewee was given the opportunity for four unique interviews with different technical questions. Interviewers got valuable experience interviewing their peers, and interviewees got precious feedback on their skills and resumes.

On Monday Intuit visited the lab for an informal question and answer session. Attendance was very high and a multitude of people had their questions about the company answered.

## Career Fair Week Visits
**MOOG** – Tuesday 12:30 – 2:00pm<br>
**Constant Contact** – Tuesday 6:30 - 7:30pm<br>
**UTC Aerospace** – Thursday 6:30 – 7:30pm<br>
**Datto** – Friday 12:00 – 1:00pm

All of these companies will be meeting and the lab and are here to tell anyone present about themselves. We’ve been told that both UTC Aerospace and Datto will be bringing food for anyone who attends their presentations as well.

After this Friday’s meeting, we’ll be having a tech talk on Designing Languages with Katherine Whitlock in the SSE Lab.

This Saturday from 2:00 to 4:00pm the SSE is hosting a 261 exam 1 review session. It will be held in Golisano 2400. If you know anyone in the class, or happen to be in the class yourself, be sure to get them to attend so they can be prepared for the first exam!

## Projects
