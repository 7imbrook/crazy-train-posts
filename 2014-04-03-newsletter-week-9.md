Welcome back everyone! I trust everyone has had a productive break! We’re into semester week 9, which means it’s time for another SSE newsletter!

## Upcoming Events
This Friday we have Ethan Jurman giving a presentation on Blender – it’s after the meeting at 5:30! It will be live streamed to our YouTube account [https://www.youtube.com/user/SSETechtalks](https://www.youtube.com/user/SSETechtalks).

The Night of Microtalks is April 9th at 7PM in the lab! Email <talks@sse.se.rit.edu> with your short 5-minute presentations (on anything!) beforehand and you may present it to the crowd! Want to share your knowledge of sporks? Do it! Want to give a primer on OCaml? I invite you to! Presenters earn memberships!

RIT is having open houses on April 5th and April 12th! Be sure to be on your best behavior for the tours, and if you’re feeling especially saucy, you can email <pr@sse.se.rit.edu> to help out with the open house events!

Also on April 12 is SSE Builds a Box Fort! 5pm in the Atrium, members only, be there! Men may rise and fall, but box forts will be forever!

On April 27th the SSE is going all natural – we’re visiting Letchworth Gorge! It is a nearby location with beautiful vistas of forest and waterfalls. Come check it out with us! We meet in the lab at noon to leave.

##SSE Constitution Amendment
The SSE constitution has been amended! The changes allows members who will be eligible in the fall but don’t currently meet the year requirement to run – this was possible under our old constitution and was considered a regression and has been be fixed.
