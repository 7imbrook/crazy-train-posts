## Welcome back everyone!
I hope you’re having an eventful week 3 here at RIT! Speaking of events… we have a number of exciting events planned for the coming weeks.

### But first, the past!
Over the intersession we held our incredibly successful RapDev event, where, for three weeks, a group of highly driven individuals toiled from 10 to 5 on our new project: Mycroft. Mycroft is the new lab AI. It is designed to be extended with applications which improve its awareness of the world and increase its functionality. With over 20 unique applications written for the core server thus far, Mycroft’s usefulness is unquestionable! If you’d like to help work on further improvements to Mycroft, the Mycroft project team meets at 5pm on Mondays in the lab; simply show up and show interest!

Over the first weekend of the semester, the SSE watched the superbowl, and Becca won! Well, Seattle won, but Becca, Jake, and Chad won our hearts with their delicious 7:14 chili. Honorable mention goes to Benjin Dubishar for his ‘Chilly’ chili. It holds a special place in our hearts for its ingenuity and flavor.

After last week’s meeting we had an excellent presentation from Shayde, our Fundraising head, on crypto currencies. Attendees claim that the presentation was highly informative and relevant to current newsworthy events. A recording of the presentation should be available online in short order.

### And now, back to the future!
Mock Interview Day is scheduled for Saturday, Feb 22nd! Sign up at http://bit.ly/MIoj2K to be interviewed or to be an interviewer! Prepare yourselves for your future interviews with experienced individuals who ask you the tough questions that you’ll be expected know how to answer! After the event (which ends at 5pm), an informal formal dinner will be held off-campus for those who are interested.

The career fair is Feb 26th. During that week we’ll have a number of visits from various companies. On Monday the 24th, Intuit will be in the lab at 6:30pm to present. On that Tuesday, Constant Contact will here at 6:30pm. That Thursday, the 26th, UTC will be in the lab 6:30pm (complete with our very own Tom Owens)! Word has it that they’ll be bringing pizza for everyone who attends!

### Projects Updates
Imagine RIT is coming up sooner than we think, and our projects are preparing to show themselves off to all of campus. Here's what's planned for this year:

#### Mycroft - The friendly lab AI and assistant

Over break the rapid development team created the foundations for a lab assistant. The projects is made up of a central server and any number of applications that can be quickly plugged into the system. Development is still happening and anyone can create an application for Mycroft - you are highly encouraged to do so. Once again, those interested in working with Mycroft meet on Mondays at 5pm in the lab.

#### Mechanical Archer

The team is in their later stages of development; they have a working prototype that has shots fired. This beast of a machine is even closer to loading, aiming and firing all on its own. Share an interest in automated medieval weaponry? Email <projects@sse.se.rit.edu> for their meeting times and more information about how you can help!

#### Voxel Display Prototype - Creating a 3D pixel

Jesse Jurman is heading off research - with the help of the Imaging Science department - to create a voxel display. Running with the momentum of last year’s Volumetric Display, we are continuing to explore 3D technologies from both a hardware and software perspective. If you’d like to help design the prototype, contact Jesse Jurman personally, or email <projects@sse.se.rit.edu> for more information!

#### Occulus Shopping

Ryan Hudson is leading the SSE into the virtual world. Your online shopping experience will never be the same once you look at yourself in that three piece suit in a virtual mirror from the comfort of your home. Sound intriguing? Email your support to <projects@sse.se.rit.edu> and ask for more information on how you can help make it so!
